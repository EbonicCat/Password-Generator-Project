# NOTICE: I updated the program to where the special character is optional, and I made it to where the random special character is based on the oneâ€™s place value of letterSum

# Strengths of Program: Customizable minimal length, cannot be determined by the website's name, includes both uppercase and lowercase letters

# Weaknesses of Program: Couldn't work for passwords that can only use specific special characters
